# Secure-File-Sharing-System
Implementation of a secure file sharing system using Google Drive API, Python, AES-GCM and Shamir’s secret sharing scheme.
A short description of what is done in the project:
•	Created Google API console account and obtained credentials for Google Drive API.
•	Initialized Flask API in Python and integrated authentication, file upload, and other functionalities (view, delete, edit). 
•	Utilized Python’s “cryptography” library for AES-GCM encryption and PyCryptodome’s “scrypt” for salting.
•	Implemented Shamir’s Secret Sharing scheme for generating and sharing secret keys with file URLs.
